# please-read-me
The ultimate open source read me editor with all the features that you need üòÅ !

The idea of this project comes to me when I first needed to write a readme for internship.
I wanted to use a convenient tool with a cool design, a simple interface and all the features that I needed.
But after some research online I found out that there was no tools that was perfect for my needs. So I decided to create my own.

This is how Please Read Me was created !
